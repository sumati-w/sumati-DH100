through the room\n\n[Pre-Chorus]\nDancin' around the lies we tell\nDancin' around big eyes, as well\nEven the comatose\nThey don't dance and tell\n[Chorus]\nWe live in cities you'll never see on-screen\nNot very pretty, but we sure know how to run things\nLivin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams\nAnd you know, we're on each other's team\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air\nSo there\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo all the cups got broke\nShards beneath our feet\nBut it wasn't my fault\nAnd everyone's competing\nFor a love they won't receive\n'Cause what this palace wants is release\n\n[Chorus]\nWe live in cities you'll never see on-screen\nNot very pretty, but we sure know how to run things\nLivin' in ruins of a palace within my dreams\nAnd you know, we're on each other's team\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nI'm kind of over gettin' told to throw my hands up in the air\nSo there\nI'm kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care\nSo there\n[Chorus]\nWe
