# Introduction 
Growing up listening to Lorde, I’ve found myself drawn to her music and have decided to delve into her lyrics for my project. I will be discovering her most commonly used lyrics in both Pure Heroin and Melodrama as well as drawing positive or negative sentiments from her work. Finally, I’ll be looking at the frequency of some of the words used within the albums

# Research Questions

[Primary Question] What are the most commonly used words in both Pure Heroin and Melodrama?

What are the themes / sentiments of both the albums — and does one present differently than the other? 

Knowing that the artist had undergone a massive growth period between her two works, how frequently does the artist use the word “love” or “lovers” and themes of youth in both her albums?
