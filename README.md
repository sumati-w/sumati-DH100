# sumati-DH100
The github repository for my DH100 final project

My final project will be exploring the musical artist Lorde and her albums Pure Heroine and Melodrama. Growing up listening to Lorde, I’ve found myself drawn to her music and have decided to delve into her lyrics for my project. I will be discovering her most commonly used lyrics in both Pure Heroin and Melodrama as well as drawing positive or negative sentiments from her work. Finally, I’ll be comparing the two albums to works of other female artists.
